HR Analytics in Power BI
In this Power BI project, our team explored and analyzed Human Resources data for a fictional software company. The project aimed to provide deep insights into workforce demographics, performance metrics, and employee attrition trends.

The dataset was imported, cleaned, and explored using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. Advanced DAX functions were applied to build dynamic and interactive dashboards that empower HR decision-makers with real-time, data-driven insights.

The analysis concluded with an in-depth look into employee attrition, identifying key factors that influence turnover and offering actionable recommendations to enhance employee retention.

This project serves as a model for leveraging Power BI in HR analytics to support strategic workforce planning and improve organizational outcomes.
